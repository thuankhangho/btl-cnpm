Waste collection is often designated to an organization that provides professional waste management services. A typical waste collection process involves (1) back officers, who operate a central system to create calendar, coordinate front collectors and janitors, (2) collectors, who drive different types of vehicles and (3) janitors who manually collect garbage from Major Collecting Points (MCPs). Calendar and tasks were assigned among teams of janitors and coordinated by back officers. These assignments are often arranged in a weekly basic. Back officers also plan which vehicles to use and their routes. This planning activity happens every month. Everyday, the back officers sent messages with information about collecting route and time to collectors and janitors. Janitors use trollers to collect garbage in their assigned areas and deliver to the MCPs. Collectors will pick up garbage from all janitors at a MCP. One collector drives only one vehicle during his working shift. The collector will drive through several MCPs with a predetermined route by back officers.

Organization X is contracted to develop an information management system called UWC 2.0 in order to improve efficiency of garbage collection of Service provider Y. The solution will include a Task Management module that allows:
Back officers to:
  1. Have an overview of janitors & collectors, their work calendar
  2. Have an overview of vehicles and their technical details (weight, capacity, fuel consumptions, etc)
  3. Have an overview of all MCPs and information about their capacity. Information should be updated from MCPs every 15 minutes with the availability of at     least 95% of their operating time.
  4. Assign vehicles to janitors and collectors
  5. Assign janitors and collectors to MCPs (task)
  6. Create a route for each collector. Assigned route is optimized in term of fuel consumption & travel distance.
  7. Be able to send message to collectors & janitors

Collectors & janitors to:
  1. Have an overview of their work calendar
  2. Have a detail view of their task on a daily and weekly basic. All important information should be displayed in one view (without scrolling down). 
  3. Be able to communicate with collectors, other janitors & back officers. The messages should be communicated in a real-time manner with delay less than 1 second.
  4. Check in / check out task every day
  5. Be notified about the MCPs if they are fully loaded
  
There are some constraints to the development of UWC 2.0. There exists a current system UWC 1.0 with a database. UWC 2.0 is expected to import and to use the existing data from UWC1.0. It is expected that the Task Management to be inter-operable with the UWC 1.0 as much as possible. The system should be able to handle real-time data from at least 1000 MCPs at the moment and 10.000 MCPs in five years. UWC 2.0 system interfaces should be in Vietnamese, with an opportunity to switch to English in the future. 

Task 1: Requirement elicitation
1.1. Identify the context of this project. Who are relevant stakeholders? What are their current needs? What could be their current problem? In your opinion, what benefits UWC 2.0 will be for each stakeholder?
1.2. Describe all functional and non-functional requirements that can be inferred from the project description. Draw a use-case diagram for the whole system.
1.3. For the Task assignment module, draw its use-case diagram and describe the use-case using a table format.
